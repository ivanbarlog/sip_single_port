notify.php
##########

kamailio calls `notify.php` from within the kamailio.cfg periodically every X seconds and based on the output kamailio decides if the REGISTER message which purpose is to initiate process of switching ports will be sent to server kamailio instance.

`notify.php` will output `1` when file `../notify` exists eg. you can trigger it by simply creating the file `touch ../notify`
When you want to stop triggering notification you simply remove the file eg. `rm ../notify`

kamailio will try to parse IP:port for re-registration in /usr/local/src/location - this file needs to be created on each kamailio server separately and it will contain IP on first line and port on second line
