Valgrind usage:
disable debug mode in kamailio; disable forking

run kamailio through valgrind:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=yes kamailio
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all kamailio
```


From Valgrind's [Quick Start Guide](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html)

Your program will run much slower (eg. 20 to 30 times) than normal, and use a lot more memory. Memcheck will issue messages about memory errors and leaks that it detects.
